I thought that using the cloud-hosted DBMS was a good experience for the most part, 
and I was able to set up the database and run queries on it somewhat smoothly. I 
did run into some issues with the dbms, specifically being logged out after every 
3 - 4 queries. Another small issue that I ran into while using it, was that in 
some situations where the query itself was an invalid query, it would take several 
seconds to still output that value; however, from my experience last homework, 
this didn't really seem to occur while running commands on the terminal. 
However, this may be impacted by the queries that are being run.

I would recommend this to a fellow student for tinkering and experimentation, 
because it was pretty cool, and especially being able to run different queries 
at the same time to try out different variations of where clauses, for example, 
was pretty helpful. In addition, being able to type up and edit queries within 
the query submission areas, with syntax highlighting, providing a smooth UI.

I would reommend it to future co-workers for their projects as well, because 
of the features I previously mentioned, as well as its ability to work with 
large amounts of data which might not be so easy on a personal laptop. 
In addition, it is not possible to collaborate with co-workers on projects 
or databases if they are stored on a single device, but I think that a 
cloud-hosted DBMS would allow for many people to access the database and 
run queries on it, because it is not in a single, remote location.
